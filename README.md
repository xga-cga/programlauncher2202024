algorithm for programlauncher with config file
6/8/2023

Design a program launcher for windows C99 using the GTK GUI. Have a form with 4 options: select a program location to run, select a text file containing command line options for the program, a button to save the program options to a config file ending in .cfg, a button run the specified program and command line arguments. The program launcher should save the program name, location, and command-line options to a .cfg file. The config file should be read from to load the specified arguments into program launcher on startup.   The program should define the GUI layout and widget names without relying on a Glade UI file.
